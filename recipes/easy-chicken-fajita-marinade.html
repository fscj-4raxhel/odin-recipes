    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This simple chicken fajita marinade has been bounced around in my family
      for at least 15 years. It's tasty, easily altered for a twist on the
      taste, and can be easily prepared in under 15 minutes. Serve with other
      fajita elements such as sautéed green bell pepper, white or yellow onions,
      jalapeño slaw, homemade tomato or mango salsa, etc.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Whisk vegetable oil, chili powder, lime juice, honey, garlic powder,
        paprika, and black pepper together in a medium bowl until well combined.

        Place chicken strips in large resealable plastic bag. Pour in marinade
        and knead to coat; squeeze out excess air, seal bag, and marinate in the
        refrigerator for 4 hours to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat an outdoor girll for medium-high heat and lightly oild the
        grate. Remove chicken strips from marinade; discard any unused marinade.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook chicken on the preheated grill until browned on all sides and
        chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes per side. An
        instant-read meat thermomoeter inserted into the thickest piece should
        read at least 160 degrees F(70 degrees C).
