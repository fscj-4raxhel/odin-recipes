    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This homemade pumpkin pie made with mashed, cooked pumpkin is my family's
      favorite. Skip the canned pumpkin and store-bought crust and make your
      holiday pumpkin pie from scratch with a flaky homemade pastry crust and a
      deliciously spiced pumpkin filling. Hope you enjoy it as much as my family
      does!
